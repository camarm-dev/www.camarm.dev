        <h2>My objectives ðŸŽ“</h2>
        <p>
          I wanna use and administrate servers but also code in my future job. I really enjoy making these on my free
          time and absolutely want to make them my job.<br>
          Actually in third grade, I want to make an informatics BUT after the high school. Iâ€™m also hyped to study at
          school 42. I think the devops job is a good option to balance between servers and code.

        <h2>My engagements ðŸ‘Š</h2>
        <p>
          I'm always trying to use open source and privacy respectives tools. TThatâ€™s why I host alternatives to GAFAM's services on my server.
          I use Linux (Ubuntu) 90% of the time to code and work and only use windows to play games. Linux is today a good alternative to windows, itâ€™s free, open source and powerful !
          I can't stand data privacy violation made particularly bu the GAFAM. That's why I support open source and open projects !

        <h2>Languages and technologies ðŸ’¾</h2>
        <p>
          Since Iâ€™ve started coding, I made a lot of web applications and PWA, with dynamic javascript and a Python backend in Flask.
          As database, I mostly use Mongodb and I can't separate it. By working on Linux, I know this OS and the use of the shell.
          With my server I learnt how to properly deploy and maintain applications and their load management.
          I'm currently learning nuxt.js and Rust.
          You can check <NuxtLink to="/work">my projects</NuxtLink> to see me in action.

        <h2>Experiences ðŸ§ª</h2>
        <p>
          Last year I made a portfolio for Ondine CAMPONOVO. It was my first experience with a client.
          I did a training period at a hardware maintenance company where I learnt a lot of things on hardware and clients relations.
          It was my first experience in company. For 3 years now, I manage self-hosted services on my home server.
