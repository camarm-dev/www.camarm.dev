        <h2>My objectives</h2>
        <p>
          I wanna use and administrate servers but also code in my future job. I really enjoy making these on my free
          time and absolutely want to make them my job.<br>
          Actually in third grade, I want to make an informatics BUT after the high school. I’m also hyped to study at
          school 42. I think the devops job is a good option to balance between servers and code.
